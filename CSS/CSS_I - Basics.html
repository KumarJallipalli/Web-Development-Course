    CSS - Cascading Style Sheets
        - CSS is language used to describe the STYLE of the webpage/document
        - But to actually style something, we need to have that something called some structure
            - i.e., why CSS will always require HTML & we learn HTML before CSS.

<!-- 
    Why de owe need CSS..?
        - It plays an important role in displaying the UI
        - It is one of the reason which keeps the Users from going away
-->

<!-- 
    Basic format of CSS
        - Selector → It selects tag/content where CSS to be applied [where to be applied]
        - Property → it defines the which CSS style for that particular selector [what style to be applied]
        - Value → its the value of the property [how much to be applied]
        
    - Property & value always comes in pairs in CSS
    - Semicolon ( ; ) → it is not mandatory but V.Imp to follow as programming standards

    How to include CSS styles in HML..?
        1. Inline CSS
        2. Internal CSS
        3. External CSS

    1. Inline CSS 
        - Writing style directly inline with HTML element
        - It uses `style` attribute to give Styles to page
            - The value of “style” will  have the property:value pair.
        - It is given inside the start tag only
        - We will never use this as this makes code redundant 
            [ As we need to write style to each & every element one by one ]
    
    2. Internal CSS
        - Using `<style>` tag in the same document/file to give styles to the page
        - This was always given in `<head>` tag
        - This address the inline CSS issue but it makes code larger & lenghtier.
        - Hence we don’t use this type of styling.
    
    3. External CSS
        - Writing CSS in a separate document/file & linking it HTML file
        - We use `<link>` tag to link the CSS file with HTML file & is always given in `<head>` tag
        - This address the above 2 issue’s & is used to give styling in real life projects
