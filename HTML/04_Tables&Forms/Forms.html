        FORMS in HTML:
            - Forms in HTML are used to collect "data" from user
            - Just like how <table> tag creates a table in HTML, <form> tag is used to create a form in HTML
            - But, where should be the form's collected data go/store (or) what action needs to be performed ..?
            - We have an attribute called "action"
                - To define which actions needs to be performed on the collected once the form is submitted
                - To decide where the form's collected data should be sent
                ex: <input action="action.js" -> send the form's data to js file named action
    -->

    <!-- 
        input:
            - It is a V.Imp form element
            - We know <form> element is used to collect different/multiple forms of data from user.
            - That means we require an element which can take diff diff types of inputs from user
            - That element is <input/> element

            - But how can a single elment be able to collect diff diff types of data from user ..?
            - <input/> element is having an attribute called "type", by which it is able to create multiple inputs
            - i.e., why <input/> element is used to create multiple form control

            ex:
            - <input /> -> it is same as <input type="text" />
            - <input type="text" /> -> used to take combination of letters, numbers & sp.char as input
            - <input type="password" /> -> used to take input same as text type but by default the inputs are hidden
    -->

    <!-- 
        placeholder:
            - It is an attribute of <input/> element
            - It is used to display a placeholde value in an <input/> element for the user, until the user enters his actual value.
    -->

    <!-- 
        Label:
            - Label element represents a caption to a specific item in the UI
            - It is used to establish a connection between the elements
    -->

    <!-- 
        Button:
            - <button> element is used to submit the form’s data
    -->

    <form action="/action">

        <!-- 1st method -->
        <label>
            Username:
            <input type="text" placeholder="Username">
        </label> 
        
        <!-- 2nd method -->
        Username:
        <input type="text" placeholder="USername">
        
        <!-- 
            The difference between 1st & 2nd method is:
            - In 1st method, we used <label> element, which creates a connection between the text “Username” & <input/> element
                - Here, “Username” became caption to the <input/> element with the help of <label>
                - So, if we select the “Username” through cursor, it will highlight the input box && the cursor will be re-directed to input box
                - In this way, a connection is formed etween 2 elements
            - In the 2nd method, we directly written the code, So, here it doesn’t have any connection between the two elements.
                - Those two are independent from each other
        -->

        <!-- 
            but there is a another way of using this <label> element called “Classical Approach”
        -->

        <!-- Classical Approach -->
        <label for="username"> Username: </label>
        <input type="text" id="username">

        <!-- 
            It will behave the same as above’s 1st method code, but here we changed the writing style of code
                - here too both the “Username” from <label> element & <input/> elements are connected
                - Previously, the connection is made using a sinle <label> element
                - But now, the connection is made through the “for” & “id” attributes of <label> & <input/> elements
                        - The values of these attributes must be same in order happen a connection between them.
        -->


        <!-- 
            Button:
                - <button> element is used to submit the form’s data
        -->
        <button>submit</button>
        <form action="/server.js">

            <button>Hello</button>

            </div>

            <button>submit</button>
        </form>
        <!-- 
            In the above code, we have 3 buttons:
                1. outside the <foem> element → No action is performed as there is no data to submit
                2. inside <form> element before the data <input/> elements → performs the submission
                3. inside <form> element after the data <input/> elements → performs the submission too
        -->

        <!-- 
            That means, No matter what  if a button element is inside a form element, it will submit the data collected.
            
            - And the data will be submitted to that file where it was mentioned in action attribute
                ex: server.js [ as it was given in the action attribute of form element ]
        -->

        <!-- 
            There are 3 types of behavior performed by this <button> element depending excluding on where the button is located
                1. type = “submit”
                    1. if it is inside the form element, submits the form’s collected data
                    2. if it is outside the form element, No action is performed
                2. type = “submit”
                    1. if it is inside the form element, just clickable No submission [ behaves as outside the form element ]
                    2. if it is outside the form element, just clickable with No submission
                3. type = “reset”
                    1. if it is inside the form element, Reset’s the form’s enetered data by user
                    2. if it is outside the form element, No action is performed
        -->

        <!-- Button types -->
        <button>Submit</button>     <!-- same as the type="submit" -->
        <button type="submit"> Submit </button>
        <button type="reset"> Reset </button>
        <button type="button"> normal </button>


        <!-- 
            We can also define the same buttons using <input/> elements
                - value atribute defines the name of the button, if none given ⇒ no name for button
                - But we don’t use this writing style as it is not a good practice  
        -->

        <!-- 
            In the above code:
            1st thing:
                - Here, "name" attribute plays a mojor role
                - It helps in grouping the multiple options together
                - "Grouping" -> user will be able to select only 1 option out of many
                - Even if he selects multiple opt, other's will be de-selected
            2nd thing:
                - value is very important, as these buttons default values will be ON (or) OFF
                - If we specify the "value" attribute explicitly, 
                    - it will take this field's value as the actual value in the "name=value" pair
        -->

        <!-- 
            Major difference between CHeckboxes & Radio Buttons,
                    - We can select only 1 option in case of Radio button, 
                    - where as in checboxes, we can select multiple options 
                    - [Even when both of them are grouped using “name“ atttribute]

                - selected → attribute makes any option selected by default [pre-selection]

            Range:
            - used to give larger selection values, instead of checkboxes & radio buttons
                - min → attribute used to give the LOWER limit
                - max → attribute used to give the UPPER limit
                - value → attribute used to give the preset value
                    - If it clashes with step value, then it will take the "nearest upper step value", Only if “min” is not defined
                - step → attribute used to give the step incremental/decremental
