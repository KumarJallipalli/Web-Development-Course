    HTML is NOT Case-Sensitive
        - Hence `<tags>` are also NOT Case-Sensitive
        - But `<Emmets>` are Case-Sensitive

    **Comments in HTML:**
        - Comments in HTML are ignored by browser & it won’t be displayed to End-User.
        - These comments are generally used by developers for better documentation purpose, 
            so that the other developer can understand it [code].

<!-- 
    **Div Element**: [Content Division Element]
        - Div is used to group elements together (or) acts as an container to hold other elements
        - Div is a block-level Element

    **Span Element**:
        - Span is also a generic container used to hold the other html elements or group elements together
        - But, span is an in-line element.

        HTML Lists:
        ----------
            HTML Lists are used to specify list of items.
            There are 3 types of Lists in HTML, they are:
            - Ordered List
            - Unordered List
            - Description List
    -->

    <!-- 
        1. The <ol> tag represent an ordered list of items.
            - But to actually display the list of items, we need to use <li> tag → list item
    -->
    <ol type="I" reversed start="2">
        <li>ONE</li>
        <li>TWO</li>
        <li>THREE</li>
        <li>FOUR</li>
    </ol>
    <!-- 
        type -> describes the list numbering type. [1, a, A, i, I. There is no "none"]
        reversed -> describes the list numbering in reverse manner
        start -> used to predefine the start No. of list numbering. [It should always be in 1,2... NOT roman or alphabetical]
            - if we give both start & reversed attributes together, 
            then the numbering will start from given start value & then decrease.
    -->

    <!-- 
        2. The <ul> element represents an unordered list of items.
    -->
    <ul type="none">
        <li>Eat</li>
        <li>Code</li>
        <li>Sleep</li>
        <li>Repeat</li>
    </ul>
    <!-- 
        type -> describes the list numbering type. [square, circle, disc & none]
    -->

    <!-- 
        <li> tags can be used to directly display the list of items
        → But by default, it displays content in un-ordered list
        → These behave as an individual elements, hence we cannot change the type of list items all together even with <div> tag 
    -->

    <!-- 
        3. The <dl> element represents a description list.
            - Instead of <li>, it has 2 elements called <dt> & <dd>
            - The <dt> → "description term" element specifies a term in the list.
            - The <dd> → "description detail" element provides the description/definition/value for the preceding term (`<dt>`)
            - There is NO specific rule that <dd> should always come after <dt> , These can come in any of the combination

    <!-- 
        Anchor Element <a> :

            - `<a>` tag is used to add links in our webpage
            - `<a>` tag converts a normal text into “hypertext”

            - href → hypertext reference is must attribute for `<a>` tag
                    - This will have the destination/linked page URL
                    - We can give “href” values using 2 methods
                        - `Absolute` Add → giving full add of website
                        - `Relative` Add → giving add relative to absolute
            - target -> it describes where to open the destination/linked page. [_blank, _self, _parent & _top]
            - download → used to download the file

            - To create links that open in the user's email application so as to let them send a new mail
                - < a href = “ mailto: kumar.jallipalli@gmail.com “ > Mail to Kumar </a>
            - To link Telephone numbers,
                - < a href = “ tel: +9988774455 “ > Call to Kumar </a>
    -->


    <!-- 
        Image ELement `<img/>` :

            - <img/> element is used to embed images in web pages
            - The ”src” attribute is **required**, and contains the URL which points out to the image to be embeded.
                - We can give the value for “src”
                        - Locally → by downloading the img & giving it’s path in the “src”
                        - Online → the whole image’s absolute address from internet as the URL
            - The ”alt” attribute holds the textual replacement for the image, which is mandatory and **incredibly useful** for accessibility
                - screen readers read the attribute value out to their users so they know what the image means.
                - Alt text is also displayed on the page if the image can't be loaded for some reason
                    - for example, network errors, content blocking, or linkrot.
                - Setting this attribute to an empty string (`alt=""`) 
                  indicates that this image is *not* a key part of the content & broken img symbol is not displayed as well
            - “loading” → Indicates how the browser should load the image
                - eager → Loads the image immediately, even if image is currently NOT within the visible viewport (default value).
                - lazy → Defers loading the image until it reaches a calculated distance from the viewport, as defined by the browser.
                    - This generally improves the performance of the content in most typical use cases.
